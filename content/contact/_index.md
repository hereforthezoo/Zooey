If you're looking to submit an article, feel free to send in your idea using the form below and someone from our editing team will get back to you soon. Every article that gets published on Zooey goes through our amazing editors just to make sure that the message you're trying to put out there comes across as clearly as possible. They'll give you feedback, but at the end of the day your article is yours and we will never make any changes that we don't run by you first. We don't have anything complicated as far as copywrite goes, but in essence you own your article, and if you ever want to remove it for whatever reason, you absolutely can. For any other submission related questions, feel free to ask here as well!
