Tarro:

Thanks for taking the time to sit down with me. I know I've already got you doing a lot as editor in chief for the magazine, but I thought it would be valuable to take a minute to let people get to know you a bit, as well as use the opportunity a little bit later to talk about Zooey as a whole. But before we get to that, let's start with the basics! Who are you and what might people know you from?

Inter:

Hey, thanks for giving me the opportunity to participate! To answer your question, I've actually been around the zoo community a pretty long time, but I've been through several names over the years. I envy the zoos who've managed to keep one name for their whole history, but I've had a few close calls that required me to clean house. So this name, this identity, this zoosona, came to be in early 2020 like a lot of the current crop of zoos. A year and some on from the zoosadist leaks it felt like many of us needed to step up and be heard. It just so happened a pandemic started at the same time, which caused a great many people to be very online, for good and ill. And so InterestedKnot was born!

Now before we get started, as editor in chief, I hope you'll allow me to hop on my soap box for a minute. Zoosonas are a necessity of the zoo world, where the exposure of real life details are potentially life threatening. Made up identities are a necessity of persecuted minority activists as a whole, where pseodunyms and plausible deniability are a must. This zoosona, this InterestedKnot, is necessarily semi-fictional, and I want to be clear about that. Does that mean everything I say is made up? No. The truth of being a zoo, of where that part of me comes from, of my experiences and feelings and ethics, are all real, and I hope form part of a common experience zoos can relate to. The truth of my day to day life, where I live, where I work, what kinda cars I like, that has to stay hidden. It's not an easy line to walk, and I try to be mindful of how I represent myself at all times.

Finally, as a zoo magazine, first of its kind, writing for zoos by zoos and about zoos, it's really important we uphold the truth and that we're clear about what's true, what's opinion, and what's a semi-fictional identity intended to preserve safety. We're not just representing ourselves, but zoos as a whole, and that's a huge responsibility to get right. Soap box over!

Tarro:

Got it! Now, one of my favorite things about meeting new people since joining the general zoo community is talking about zoo origin stories. For some people, it's just something that they've always lived with, for others it's a dramatic realization later in their life. Some people accept themselves immediately, and others take a lot of time to figure out their attraction. Where do you fall into all of that?

Inter:

I always figure it's like any sexuality - you always got it, but you might end up taking a long time to realize it. What we grow up with and what society tells us can play a big part in this. For my part I feel fortunate I knew from a formative age; puberty kicked in and I realized my love of animals had an extra dimension. However I did struggle with having nobody to talk to, society telling me such ideas were bad, and no kind of internet to look things up on. I lived in my head till my adult life, where I found the internet and other zoos and my whole outlook turned around. I can't tell you what a revelation it is to find other zoos that are just like you, and that are people just like anyone else. Teachers, doctors, waitresses, soldiers. I found a lot of good role models and finally accepted myself.

Tarro:

Honestly, it's hard to imagine growing up as a zoo without the internet. Even the most self accepting person out there would probably struggle a little bit with some negative feelings in isolation, especially since it's not the kind of thing that you could stop by the library and pick up a book on. And even if you could, I can't imagine that that information would have any kind of positive outlook on it. You mentioned that you lived "in your head". Did you ever have the chance to open up to anyone about it, or were you forced to totally close off about all aspect of your attractions until those online community spaces started forming?

Inter:

Yeah it's wild growing up that way. Like growing up before telephones or TV I suppose. The most that I had was a treasured book, one I can recommend to all your readers, it's called 'My Secret Garden' by Nancy Friday. It's a collection of women's sexual fantasies in the 70s, at a time where it was thought women didn't really have any. They were varied and intense and scandalous, and also involved very detailed fantasies about sex with animals. I knew I wasn't alone at least.

But yes, I did have nobody I could open up to or talk to about this in any way. It was tough. I actually got my writing started around then as a hobby, writing down my very own book of sexual fantasies. It was no Shakespeare but got me through. I crafted whole worlds of where I wanted to be. Nothing about that changed till I found online spaces, though I should point out that I wasn't on the internet from day zero, those online spaces formed incredibly early on and had been around for a few years by the time I got online.

Tarro:

So, fast forward to now and you're a pretty prominent voice in certain zoo spaces, and in general are someone that's positively regarded. What is it exactly that inspired you to want to put your time and effort into a zoo project like this? Is there some reason in particular that you wanted to try and create something for the community?

Inter:

Well I'll be honest I started out in the present community for my own needs; I'd been absent some years until my own desire to speak up and be seen and express myself again could be contained no longer. It doesn't feel that long since 2020, but so much has happened, and being around inspiring folks and amazing projects and seeing the modern day community develop out of the ashes of what came before, it seemed just a natural next step to help others and become a part of community projects myself. Yours is not the first modern zoo project I've been a part of, but it may be my best fit yet. Writing is my passion, and has been from a young age. I'm a lifelong furry too; I found a name for that part of myself when I was first finding zoos online and I really find it goes hand in hand (hand in paw?) with my zoosexuality.

Tarro:

Huh, so if you don't mind my asking, did you find furry through zoo? Or was it the other way around?

Inter:

Actually, neither! I mean, my zoosexuality I believe came first, emerging along with sexual maturity. But that came from a background of loving animals and being interested in animals my entire life. Then on top of that as a kid you get steeped in a culture of talking animals and anthropomorphic animals and animal stories, and it all just about crystallized when I first got online, found zoos, and found there was this thing called furry and I found I fitted all the criteria. At this point furry feels like just one more facet of an inherent affinity for animals in culture, a modern instance of what is in fact an ancient human condition, and I feel it coexists with my zoosexuality in parallel. We should write an article about that!

As it turned out, the furry fandom is ultimately where I found my home as a writer, and I was able to really refine and hone my work professionally, collaborating with other writers and editors, eventually being approached for publication. I'm really looking forward to bringing my passion for writing into this project, as editor in chief, and making sure we're the best we can be for the zoo community.

Tarro:

You can tell that you're a professional because you managed to provide a perfect segue into our next topic without even being prompted! Lets talk about the magazine itself, and your role within it. A lot of people probably have no idea what an editor really does, or what exactly that process looks like. If someone wanted to submit an article and it ended up on your metaphorical desk, what do you do, and what happens next?

Inter:

Totally by accident! I can't even spell Segway. Now, editing is something that comes up a lot in the writing world, every writer does it, and frequently writers edit for one another too. Think of it like proof reading your friend's work, finding typos, that kinda thing. Formal editing though gets a lot more involved and tends to operate across a bunch of levels. You start with typos and grammar, but then you work your way up through style, pacing, themes, arcs and so on. Formal editing for publication in traditional print media can involve edit passes going into the double digits and may even involve issues that extend more into how your book will or wont be saleable in the wider world of literature.

As for my metaphysical desk, we tend to call submissions the slush pile. Any time we want to publish an article, we take a look at the slush pile and pick something we like, something that meets our submission criteria and ideally something that fits the particular theme of the magazine we're putting out next, if applicable. Now we're still hammering out our processes, so this isn't hard and fast rules, but in general what I'm describing is what happens. Next phase is the copy editing, either myself or one of our staff will check for basic typos and grammar, spelling, commas and so on. After that I really like to take a long hard look at what the article is about and whether we can back up what we're saying in it. Opinion pieces are all well and good, but some kind of citation will help bring your readers along with you.

And that's the key with all of it, I put myself in the shoes of the reader. Are they gonna agree with the article, are they gonna enjoy it, be uplifted, be inspired by it, or even disagree passionately with it? And disagreement is healthy, don't get me wrong - above all I want our readers to be engaged and not lose them along the way. Our reader's time is valuable; if they're reading our stuff it had better be the best that it can be and not 10 minutes of their life they'll never get back.

Tarro:

That sounds like a pretty intensive process! Does that mean that this project is for experienced authors only, or is it still worth it for someone with an idea to take a try at writing something?

Inter:

I would say to any budding authors, any of our valuable contributors, don't be put off, don't be daunted. The zoo community and the writers within it are not vast in number and you all have a voice and you all have things you deserve to say. Good ideas, good subjects, the kernel of a good article, these are always in short supply and we will always welcome your input. Write something today!

Tarro:

I think both of us have ideas for what we would like to get out of Zooey, and the directions that we could take it. In an ideal world for you, where would you like to see this project grow? What kind of impact are you hoping that it'll have?

Inter:

I hope it's not remiss of me to mention other projects, but I'd love to see us grow into something like a clearinghouse for zoo ideas, essays, thoughts, opinions, the likes of which I haven't seen since the AdjectiveSpecies website (sadly now defunct). There are so many things to be said and so many people to uplift and inspire. And we're not just writing for ourselves, but for all the others who look upon our community from the outside. ZooierThanThou is one pillar of that, Zooey Magazine will become the next as we tell our own story in our own voice and refuse to let others tell it for us. Few things are as important and we have many lessons of history to follow.

Tarro:

I've gotta ask, just to give our readers something to look forwards to. You've talked a fair bit about how much experience you have writing. Any chance we're going to see you pen an article at some point?

Inter:

You bet! Editor in chief sounds daunting, but really we're just a handful of people stepping in wherever is needed, and that includes writing. I very much intend to write articles for the site, I just need to take the time to sit down and really distill a few things that have been rattling round my head lately. In short, watch this space.

Tarro:

I'm excited to see it when it happens! Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, I say as if we don't talk pretty much every day about this project. Are there any closing thoughts or comments you'd like to leave our readers with?

Inter:

We should talk more! I just wanna say, thank you so much to our readers and our writers for putting the time into this site. It's been a long time coming and it's still early days, but I think we're off to a strong start and it wouldn't have happened without you either, Tarro. So thanks to you too! And to all zoos out there, be strong, be proud, keep your head held high. You're all amazing.
