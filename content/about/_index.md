Zooey is a magazine and publisher featuring curated articles by community members. Within our (metaphorical) pages, you'll find amazing written works that will make you laugh, make you cry, or maybe even make you think.

We have three main goals here at Zooey

First off, we want to give a platform for zoos that have something to say. There are so many amazing people in the zoo community who have great ideas and opinions, and we want to be a centralized place where you can read and learn about those opinions without needing to worry that you're not following the right twitter account or in the right telegram chat. If you're someone that just wants to read, you can do that. But if you're someone that wants to get a message out that you think is valuable or worth hearing for the zoo community at large, you can work with us to make sure that happens.

Secondly, we want to be a positive space for zoos. Being someone attracted to animals is complicated in this day and age, and can really wear you down. As zoos ourselves, we've found that one of the best ways to feel like you're not alone is by engaging with content created by and for other zoos. And there aren't many great sources of regular zoo content out there, especially if you're someone who isn't that into podcasts. That's where we come in. We're creating articles that are the perfect length to read while finishing a morning coffee, or when you just need to take five minutes for yourself. While not every article is going to be happy, we want to make sure that we have a strong general positive message.

Finally, we want to serve as a jumping off point for other activism efforts. We want to help people connect, organize, and advance causes beneficial to the zoo movement as a whole. Whether that's conducting interviews with zoos that are creating new projects, highlighting prominent figures in the community, or allowing people with an idea to soapbox it out to others to see if anyone is interested in helping out, we want to help make the connections so that we can all move forwards.

And that's us! If you're a zoo here to enjoy some articles, feel free! We're happy to have you! If you're someone who's new to the idea of zoosexuality, and isn't sure what to think of it, you're absolutely welcome as well. Take a stroll (again, metaphorically) through our library and allow some zoos to tell you about themselves, give them a chance to show you the other side.

Thanks for reading!
