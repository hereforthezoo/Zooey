To whomever this concerns

Hi, my name is Tarro. That's not my real name, but it's the one that I choose to use online. I have two very loving parents, a couple of siblings, friends and even a best friend. I'm also lucky enough to have met someone that I absolutely love. I haven't known him for that long, a few years at this point. But I can tell that he's amazing. He loves to have fun, to play, to just run around and go for it. He can always make me smile no matter how badly my day is going, and is always willing to stay by my side when I need him for as long as I need him. I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

He also happens to be a canine. A lot of people find that weird. That I could be in love with a dog. But I want to assure you that it's not as weird as you think. Honestly, if you really got to know us, I think you'd probably find it pretty disappointingly normal. We do all the same things that normal couples do. We hang out and watch movies together. We go on dates. We celebrate each other when something goes right, we comfort each other when something goes wrong. And yes, we do also engage in other adult oriented activities, but by no means is that the summation of our relationship. I think that's something that a lot of people don't understand. I'd like to think that in your relationship you aren't just with your partner for the sex either.

I'm writing to you because I wanted to talk a bit about who I am. I know that in society people that want to have relationships with animals, often known as zoophiles or zoosexuals, are seen as bad people. But that's not even close to the full story. There are people that hurt animals for their own sadistic reasons, but that's not us. We care about animals. We see our partners not as pets, or as any kind of inferior creatures. We see our partners as people. Sentient creatures capable of making their own decisions. We strive to give our partners the autonomy that society cruelly denies them. And it's not just our partners that we care about. A majority of zoos are vegan, because they choose not to support an industry that harms animals. Of the ones that aren't vegan, a majority of them tend to be on lower meat content diets, or try and source meat from farms that are run more ethically. Most zoos are also heavily involved in the animal rights movement as well.

I just want you to know, I get that you're feeling uncomfortable about this, and that's okay. There's been years upon years of social build up telling you that humans and animals shouldn't be together. It's not easy to change that feeling in the pit of your stomach. But if it's okay with you, I want to talk a little bit about where that feeling comes from. Because all feelings do come from somewhere. In this case, this all started during the rise of the Christian movement. Not to talk badly about religion, if that's your thing. But there was a time where all sex was viewed as bad, outside of just procreation. I think it's fair to say that that was a bit of an over reach. Did you know that before then zoosexuality wasn't seen as so taboo? In fact, there are a lot of examples of early art depicting sexual activity between humans and animals from all over the globe. Early religions even have examples of bestiality between animals and gods.

As a society we've been becoming more and more open to talking about sexuality. I personally think that's a good thing. Sex is a part of who we all are, more or less to different people. It seems strange to me to view sex as something mystical or magical. Especially now that most sex is done using contraceptives, it's just rubbing nerves against each other until we release a bunch of chemicals. But I also understand that everyone is different. Still, I think most people would agree that it's great that people that love their own gender, or feel like they don't fit into their birth gender are able to express that feeling without fear. And zoosexuality is the next point of discourse that society is going to face. Or, hopefully anyway. I'm biased. I just want to be able to love my partner openly. I want to brag about him to my friends, bring him to meet my parents. I want to be able to do all the things that people do with their partners.

Anyway, this letter is getting a little bit long, so I'll wrap things up. Thank you for reading it. I really do appreciate it. I'm not asking that you suddenly become a zoo activist, or start posting the flag on your social media. All I ask is that you don't judge us just for what you see on the news. That you don't hate us just because you've been told that you should hate us. If you want, I'd even encourage you to talk to one of us. Most of us would be more than happy to chat, and answer any other questions that you might have.

I've always been bad at finishing things, whether it's leaving a message on an answering machines or finishing letters. I hope your day is going well, and I hope if you have any animals in your life, that you treat them right.

Sincerely,

Tarro
